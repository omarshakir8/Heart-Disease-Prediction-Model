# ML--Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to be able to analyze and predict the presence of heart disease in individuals. Utilizing a dataset  from kaggle.com containing health parameters like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, and using logistic regression to analyze and predict heart disease outcomes. The project involves several key steps: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature-target split, model training and evaluation, and building a prediction system.
